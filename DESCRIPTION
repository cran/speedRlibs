Author: Ilhami Visne

Description: speedRlibs is a container for the required libraries
        (jars) by speedR.  These libraries are packaged separately,
        because it is approximately 17 MB and will not be so often
        updated like speedR.  Thus it reduces the download time after
        the first installation.
